# 🧠 Network Packet Sniffer with Anomaly Alert System



---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Network Packet Sniffer with Anomaly Alert System** is a Python-based cybersecurity project designed to **monitor and analyze network traffic in real time**.  
It captures packets, detects suspicious activities like **port scanning** or **flooding attacks**, and displays them on an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

This project bridges the gap between **AI and Cybersecurity**, demonstrating how network data can be analyzed and visualized intelligently to enhance security monitoring.
